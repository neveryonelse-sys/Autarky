## 🌱 What is Autarky?

Autarky is a complete, self-replicating system that transforms sunlight and common elements into:
- **Abundant energy** (closed-loop sCO₂ generators)
- **Advanced materials** (HPHT foundry with graphene, mycelium composites)
- **Healthy environments** (photocatalytic air/water purification)
- **Wise governance** (22-portal Social OS based on Tarot archetypes)

From a single vehicle that can bootstrap complete civilization anywhere.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Researchers & Builders:
1. Check out our [6 Proof-of-Concept Experiments](/experiments/)
2. Read the [Safety Guidelines](/docs/SAFETY.md) **first**
3. Pick an experiment and start contributing

### For Everyone Else:
1. Read the [Vision Statement](/docs/VISION.md)
2. Explore the [Roadmap](/community/ROADMAP.md)
3. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/YOUR-LINK-HERE) to discuss

## 🔬 Current Focus: 6 Foundation Experiments

We're starting small to prove the core principles:

| Experiment | Status | Lead |
|------------|--------|------|
| [1. Carbon Dot Photocatalysis](/experiments/01-carbon-dots-photocatalysis/) | 🟡 Planning | *Needed* |
| [2. Mycelium Self-Healing Materials](/experiments/02-mycelium-self-healing/) | 🟡 Planning | *Needed* |
| [3. Redox Battery with Carbon Dots](/experiments/03-redox-battery/) | 🟡 Planning | *Needed* |
| [4. Social OS Simulation](/experiments/04-social-os-simulation/) | 🟢 Active | *You?* |
| [5. Hydrochar Soil Regeneration](/experiments/05-hydrochar-soil-regeneration/) | 🟡 Planning | *Needed* |
| [6. Graphene Oxide Conductive Ink](/experiments/06-graphene-oxide-ink/) | 🟡 Planning | *Needed* |

## 📁 Repository Structure
## 🧪 Why Start With These Experiments?

Each experiment proves a core Autarky principle:
1. **Carbon dots** → Waste-to-materials, photocatalysis, redox mediation
2. **Mycelium composites** → Growing materials, self-repair, biocompatibility
3. **Redox systems** → Energy storage, electron flow mastery
4. **Social OS** → Anti-fragile governance, resource allocation
5. **Hydrochar** → Carbon sequestration, soil regeneration, filtration
6. **Graphene ink** → Printable electronics, conductive networks

Together they form the foundation for the complete system.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We need:
- **Materials scientists** (carbon dots, graphene, mycelium)
- **Engineers** (thermodynamics, mechanical, electrical)
- **Biologists** (mycology, ecology)
- **Programmers** (simulations, Social OS)
- **Science communicators** (documentation, outreach)
- **Makers** (prototyping, testing)

**Steps to contribute:**
1. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](/community/CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. Choose an experiment or design that interests you
3. Join our Discord to discuss
4. Start small, document everything, share results

## ⚠️ Safety First

This project involves high temperatures, pressures, electrical systems, and biological materials. **Never experiment without proper safety equipment and knowledge.** Read [SAFETY.md](/docs/SAFETY.md) before doing anything.

## 🌟 The Vision

We're not just building another technology. We're creating:
- **A complete civilization operating system**
- **Tools that enable local abundance anywhere**
- **A new relationship with matter and energy**
- **A path to post-scarcity for all**

Join us in building the future.
