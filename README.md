## 🌱 What is Autarky?

Autarky is a complete, self-replicating system that transforms sunlight and common elements into:
- **Abundant energy** (closed-loop sCO₂ generators)
- **Advanced materials** (HPHT foundry with graphene, mycelium composites)
- **Healthy environments** (photocatalytic air/water purification)
- **Wise governance** (22-portal Social OS based on Tarot archetypes)

From a single vehicle that can bootstrap complete civilization anywhere.

## 🚀 Quick Start
