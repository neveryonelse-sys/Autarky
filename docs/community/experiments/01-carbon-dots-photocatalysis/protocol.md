# Experiment 1: Carbon Dot Synthesis and Photocatalysis

## Purpose
Demonstrate: Waste biomass → carbon dots → photocatalytic water purification

## Safety Warnings
⚠️ **Read before starting:**
- Wear gloves, goggles, lab coat
- Work in well-ventilated area
- Have fire extinguisher nearby
- No eating/drinking in lab area

## Materials Needed
- Hydrochar (from biomass, see Experiment 5)
- Melatonin supplement (99% pure)
- Deionized water
- Titanium dioxide powder (TiO₂, anatase phase)
- Glass slides or Petri dishes
- UV/blue LED light source
- Methylene blue dye (for testing)
- Spectrophotometer or colorimeter (optional)

## Part 1: Hydrochar Preparation
1. Collect dry biomass (wood chips, grass, leaves)
2. Place in pressure cooker with equal mass water
3. Heat to 200°C for 4 hours (autogenous pressure ~15 bar)
4. Cool, filter, dry solids (this is hydrochar)
5. Grind to fine powder

## Part 2: Carbon Dot Synthesis
1. Mix: 1g hydrochar + 100mg melatonin + 100mL water
2. Transfer to hydrothermal reactor or pressure tube
3. Heat to 180°C for 6 hours
4. Cool to room temperature
5. Filter through 0.22μm membrane
6. Result: Yellow-brown solution of carbon dots

## Part 3: Photocatalytic Surface Preparation
1. Clean glass slides with ethanol
2. Prepare coating solution: 1g TiO₂ + 10mL carbon dot solution + 90mL water
3. Dip-coat or spray onto glass slides
4. Dry at 100°C for 1 hour
5. Repeat coating for thicker films

## Part 4: Photocatalytic Testing
1. Prepare methylene blue solution (10mg/L)
2. Place 50mL in beaker with coated glass slide
3. Illuminate with LED light (blue, 450nm)
4. Take samples every 30 minutes
5. Measure absorbance at 664nm (methylene blue peak)
6. Compare to control (uncoated slide, dark conditions)

## Expected Results
- Carbon dots: Yellow fluorescence under UV light
- Photocatalysis: Methylene blue decolorization in hours
- Control: Little to no decolorization in dark

## Data to Collect
1. Photos of carbon dot fluorescence
2. Absorbance measurements over time
3. Notes on any variations or issues
4. Ideas for improvement

## Troubleshooting
- **No fluorescence:** Try different biomass source, adjust synthesis temperature
- **No photocatalytic activity:** Check TiO₂ coating thickness, light intensity
- **Coating peels off:** Clean glass better, try annealing at 300°C

## Next Steps
1. Scale up synthesis
2. Test on real water contaminants
3. Integrate with water harvester design
4. Explore H₂ production from water splitting
